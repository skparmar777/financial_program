# Goal:

This project creates a bookkeeping software for a small business called Toy Trucks. 

# How to use:

There is data loaded into the history files right now, so if you are interested in creating a local copy and running it, make sure to remove current data from the CSVs, but keep the header intact. For the income statement and balance sheet csv's, place the starting values in the csv.

To run, simply run as a python file. This is easiest if you open it in an IDE like pycharm and click the run button. Whenever you shut the program down, the state is saved and all the data files are automatically updated.

# Technology used
Python fuels this entire program. The GUI is using Tkinter.
